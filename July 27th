Today is July 27th.
By writtting diary in Gethub in English,I hope I can improve my second language.
Somebody may want to ask,"Why is gethub?"
Well,most of my friend does not use it,and they are not interested in IT.
I am not a professional developer,in fact,I am a senior high student.A immoral man.
I live in Shandong,China.Tomorrow will be riany.
If you found some grammer or spelling mistakes,email me.
(I think nobody will find this.)
